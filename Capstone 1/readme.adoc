Capstone 1 Tic-Tac-Toe
======================
last modified: 01.03.2018.

== Description
This is a first capstone project for the course.
The task was creating a simple text based game of tic-tac-toe.

== How to run
To run the game start the "game.py" script.

== Still to do
=== Improvement
- the task was to create a two player game but I choose to create a single player game with the idea of one day revisiting this task and creating a bot to play the game.
For now the program plays simply and stupidly, it chooses a random move.

=== Bugs
- when the player loses the game the message is still "you won"
